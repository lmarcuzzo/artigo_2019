The proper execution of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) depends on the employment of platforms specifically created to fulfill multiple NFV requirements (\textit{e.g.}, performance, integration, and management). However, existing VNF platforms implement different architectures, thus resulting in proprietary or limited solutions that do not always support important NFV specifications, such as VNF Components (VNFCs) and the Network Service Header (NSH). In this work, we introduce a comprehensive architecture for VNF platforms that supports the NFV requirements defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), while also enabling the execution of VNFCs and NSH. We implemented a VNF platform prototype, on which we conducted two different case studies, and report a series of performance evaluation experiments. Results demonstrate the intrinsic advantages of supporting VNFCs and NSH and show the flexibility of our architecture in distinct NFV scenarios.
